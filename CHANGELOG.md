## [Unreleased]

### Added
- 2D drawing canvas: bonds (single/double/triple, bold, wedge, hash) with 30° angle
  snapping and a consistent default bond length.
- Ring and conformer templates (benzene, cycloalkanes, chair/boat) with live
  preview and click-to-insert.
- Arrows: reaction, equilibrium, resonance, curved, and dashed, with adjustable
  width and head scale.
- Bracket annotations (square/round/curly) plus dagger (`†`) and double dagger (`‡`)
  objects.
- Atom labels with charges, radicals, and common alias labels
  (`Me`, `Et`, `OH`, `Ph`, `OMe`, `Boc`, `CO2Me`, `t-Bu`, `i-Pr`).
- Free **Text** annotation tool (`T`), separate from the **Atom** tool (`A`): place
  captions/labels independent of the molecule graph, edited inline on the canvas.
  Its option bar offers size, bold/italic, super-/subscript, and left/center/right
  alignment, and the toolbar Text button has a font-family dropdown; text color is set
  with the existing Color tool. Rich formatting is preserved in `.chemvas` documents
  and figure exports.
- SMILES import with cursor preview and click-to-place (requires RDKit).
- Molecule Info window with interactive 3D preview and molecular formula/weight
  (requires RDKit).
- Canonical SMILES, InChI, and InChIKey computation for the current structure;
  the Molecule Info window gained **Copy SMILES** / **Copy InChIKey** buttons that
  place the value on the clipboard (requires RDKit).
- **Export MOL** (File menu): write the **selected** structure to an MDL Molfile
  (`.mol`, V2000), preserving 2D coordinates, bond orders, and wedge/hash stereo.
  Plain-element
  structures need no RDKit; abbreviation labels (`Ph`, `CF3`, `tBu`, …) are expanded
  into explicit atoms via RDKit when it is installed.
- Figure export to SVG / PDF / PNG / TIFF with outlined glyphs and deterministic
  physical sizing (bond-length or 84/174 mm column fit).
- 2D→3D `.xyz` export of the current molecule or atom/bond selection, carrying
  charges/radicals and wedge/hash stereo (requires RDKit).
- Editing: select/move, horizontal & vertical flip, perspective rotation, and
  delta-based undo/redo.
- ChemDraw-compatible keyboard shortcut subset.
- `.chemvas` JSON document save/load (`{"type":"chemvas","version":1,...}`).
- ACS 1996 default style and color palette.
